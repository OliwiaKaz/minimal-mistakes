Version 3 has reached alpha state.

It can be downloaded from the [releases page.](https://github.com/utPLSQL/utPLSQL/releases)

It's being used now in multiple organizations with great success.   The documentation work is progressing.  However, we realize that quite a bit of work needs to be done in this area. 

Feel free to join us in our [slack chat room](http://utplsql-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/) where we communicate daily about the project.
